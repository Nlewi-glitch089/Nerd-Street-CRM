**Disabled-signin protection & admin notification**

- What it does: Blocks sign-in attempts from deactivated users and records each blocked attempt as an `ActionLog` entry (`action = signin_attempt_disabled`). Adds an admin notification bell that surfaces recent disabled-signin attempts and a small panel showing details (email, time, reason).
- Why: Prevents deactivated users from authenticating while giving admins visibility into attempted logins for security and auditing.
- Key behaviors:
  - Login endpoint rejects deactivated users and creates an `ActionLog` entry for the attempt.
  - Admin dashboard shows a bell with a count and a panel listing recent disabled-signin entries.
  - Temporary admin approvals use a minutes-select (2–5 min) that sets `TempAccessRequest.expiresAt` instead of mutating `User.role`.
- Testing notes: Use a test account (e.g., mike@nerdstgamers.com) to sign in, deactivate the account, then attempt sign-in to confirm blocking and that the admin bell/panel records the entry.
